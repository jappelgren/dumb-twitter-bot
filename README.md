## A Dumb Twitter Bot

This dumb Twitter bot will once a day post a random picture from a database of pictures and a random phrase.  The pictures will be of common objects you may have encountered at some point in your life.  The text to go along with the picture will be some variation of "If you know, you know" or "Things hit different when you're around this item".  The idea is to cash in on peoples weirdly specific nostalgia for things that don't or shouldn't illicit nostalgia.

This project is directly inspired by this tweet: https://twitter.com/itsbriancuh/status/1363653079057358848?s=20
